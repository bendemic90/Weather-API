# Weather-API
A simple weather app that displays current and future weather conditions.

## Features
* Has a start button that loads the quiz, selecting random questions.
* Correct answers should have increased your score by 1, while incorrect would deduct time from the timer. I didn't get this far though.
* Once a question is answered it SHOULD move you onto the next question, although this is not the case.


## Reasoning
Utilisation of randomisation and local storage, hiding elements and keeping it all together.

## Challenges & Process
1. I found the layout process pretty easy, I used the Captain Planet activity and bootstrapped the layout from that.
2. There's a lot of redundant code but I was running out of time to compact it all, resulting in lots of repitition and hundreds more lines than is necessary.
3. The most challenging part was the decision to upload it as an assignment OR not upload anything at all.
4. Definitely didn't leave myself enough time over the holidays to complete this.
